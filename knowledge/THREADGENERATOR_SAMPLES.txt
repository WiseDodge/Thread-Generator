Self-Learning AI Knowledge System; coined as SRP-AI Nexus



**Difficulty Level:** **Advanced**; Requires long-term development, but is scalable in phases.

** Expenses**: **FREE** if we keep all the components local and use open-source alternatives.



# Project Overview: 



AI-driven knowledge system designed to comprehensively understand the Scape & Run: Parasites mod. The catch is, unlike simple wiki scrapers, this AI will **autonomously collect, structure and refine its knowledge** over time using a **recursive learning process**. It's function is to be an interactive database and AI assistant, capable of answering complex questions, recognizing gaps within its own knowledge, and continuously improving by re-processing weak and/or incomplete areas.



# Why this matters:



Scape & Run: Parasites is an incredibly deep and complex mod, and its mechanics are difficult to fully grasp while accounting for all the interconnected relationships between other mechanics. This AI-driven system's aim is to provide a powerful, evolving knowledge resource, that allows players to get precise, well-researched answers, rather than just relying on scattered discussions or partial wiki entries.



This is a **long-term project**, and has a huge potential for both **automation** and advanced **AI-driven knowledge retention**. 



# Core Features & Goals:



:small_blue_diamond:## 1. Advanced Knowledge Base

- Web scrapes and processes all wiki pages into a structured database.

- Graph-based ontology mapping the relationships between mobs, mechanics, systems, etc.

- Vector embeddings for semantic searching and deep retrieval.



:small_blue_diamond:## 2. AI Query System

- Users can ask complex questions such as:

> "How come I hear multiple lightning despite there not being any thunderstorms?

> “What is the strongest counter to Adapted Longarms?”

- Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide answers based on the wiki data.



:small_blue_diamond:## 3. Recursive Learning w/ Self-Improvement

- AI capable of detecting weak knowledge areas (for instance; incomplete mechanics, and vague explanations

- Scheduled self-improvement cycles to refine data over time

- Logs unanswered or uncertain queries for future research



:small_blue_diamond:## 4. Optional External Research (Experimental)

- Potential to extend its knowledge beyond the wiki by searching forums, mod discussions, and Youtube transcripts

- Intelligent filters and summarizes the AI's findings to integrate its new information



:small_blue_diamond: ## 5. Multiple Interfaces 

- Command Line Interface for direct queries

- Discord bot for interactive Q&A

- Potential web dashboard for graph visualization of knowledgebase

- Future implementations of offline mode (static data retrieval)





# The challenges and Technical Complexities

(Formatted as Challenge -> Potential Solutions)





- Large, interconnected data on the mod -> Use of a local Neo4j DB

- Avoiding incorrect/missing data -> Implement recursive self-learning & user feedback loop

- Computational Efficiency -> We can start locally, and scale w/ task scheduling (cloud processing?)

- AI confidence estimation -> AI can flag low-confidence answers for future improvement (no gaslighting or 

- Avoiding rate limits -> batch processes; instead of constantly re-scraping the wiki, we can do incremental updates every few days

- Avoid cloud services -> self host flask or FastAPI

- Avoid OpenAI API calls -> fine tune local models like GPT-J, Mistral, or LLaMA

- Local Databasing -> can store data in SQLite/JSON/metadata, run Neo4j locally, and FAISS for vector searching

Component | Solution | Notes



Web Scraping     | Requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy | Free tools work fine (has rate limits); scrape in batches.



Data Storage (Graph Database)     | Local Neo4j DB    |     Use a local instance unless data grows too large. Export JSON for portability.



Vector Search (AI Embeddings)    | FAISS (Runs locally)    |     FAISS is 100% free & runs offline



AI Query System (LLM)    | Free-tier models (LLaMA, GPT-J, Mistral, etc)    |     Fine-tune local open-source models to avoid API costs.



Recursive Learning (Task Scheduling)    |  Celery + Local Scheduler    |     Use Celery for async tasks on your PC; no need for cloud based solutions.



Online Research (External API Access)    | Web Scraping or DuckDuckGo API     |     Avoid API costs by scraping relevant sources manually when we need.





User Interface (Web, Discord Bot)    | Run locally, self-host Flask/Discord bot    |     No need for hosting; we can run locally & allow external access when needed.



Scaling & Cloud Storage    |  SQLite, JSON files     |     Keep all storage local to avoid unnecessary cloud costs.



Data Constraint      | Docker     |     Data constrained within a dockerized environment would prevent resource overallocation

# :books: AIContextScraper



**Difficulty Level:** **Advanced** — Ideal for long-term modular development with scalable complexity.  

**Expenses:** **FREE** — Fully local setup using open-source libraries and tools.



---



## :mag: Project Overview:



**AIContextScraper** is a flexible and reusable scraping framework tailored for **AI-assisted documentation ingestion**. Designed to recursively crawl structured documentation-style websites (e.g., wikis, docs, developer sites), it **extracts and organizes** content into clean, tokenized `.txt` chunks, `.json` structures, and optional `.pdf` exports.  



Its primary function is to **enable easy ingestion and processing of large-scale documentation datasets** — making it perfect for:

- AI fine-tuning

- Vector DB population

- Custom GPT tools

- Offline search engines



Think of it as an **AI-ready documentation refinery**.



---



## :globe_with_meridians: Why This Matters:



Documentation often exists across dozens or hundreds of internal pages, making it inefficient to process manually. AIContextScraper solves this by:

- Recursively crawling and fetching structured content

- Organizing data for immediate LLM ingestion

- Tokenizing for compatibility with chunk-based LLMs

- Automating the entire ingestion/export pipeline



This project **enables scalable AI documentation pipelines**, and can evolve into a **core utility for your AI automation network**.

- Uses `aiohttp` & `asyncio` for performance

- Follows docs-like structures, avoiding media/broken pages



:small_blue_diamond: **2. Structured Parsing & Chunking**

- Parses pages with `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml`

- Token/word-based chunking for `.txt` output

- Extracts titles, body content, timestamps, URLs, and tokens



:small_blue_diamond: **3. Smart Exporter Modules**
